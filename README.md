# Codellate
 Next generation learning management system for CS classes
 
 Codellate is the capstone project for my senior-year programming class in high school. Work on Codellate was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent transition to online learning. While the project did reach a presentable state, it lacks several features that I wanted to implement.
 
 It is worth noting that Codellate was my first extended project. As a result, there are several poor design decisions that I learned from and avoided in later projects like [Guardpost](https://github.com/ritcheydominic/guardpost-server). I encourage those looking at my code to reflect on these decisions and also learn from the mistakes I made.
