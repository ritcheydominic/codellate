# Codellate
 Next generation learning management system for CS classes
 
 Codellate was written in the spring of 2020 as the culminating project for my senior programming class in high school. Work on Codellate was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent transition to online learning. While the project did reach a presentable state, it lacks several features that I wanted to implement.
 
 Also worth noting is that Codellate was my first extended design project. As a result, there are several poor design decisions that I learned from and avoided in later projects like wgrm. I encourage those looking at my code to reflect on the design of Codellate and also learn from the mistakes I made.
